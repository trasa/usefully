# USEFULLY 
## Some Useful Java Libraries

Collection of bits and pieces that end up being useful over time.

### JavaTime

Ask Java what time is it. I needed a way to quickly get to 
`System.currentTimeMillis()` from a script. So, here we are,
quick and dirty.

### Jersey

Utilities for Jersey 2.16. Probably out of date now.

Map Messages to MessageHandlers. When a message object of type 'X'
arrives, find the message handler method(s) that accept an 'X' and
pass the message off to those methods.

### Redis

Utilities for accessing and working with Redis keystore database.

Grab bag of utilities! Fun for all ages!
